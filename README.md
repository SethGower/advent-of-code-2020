# Advent of Code 2020

This is my repository for my solutions for [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2020. This is the first time I am doing this
competition, and have decided to take this opportunity to advance my rust
skills. I am using a template created by @Scoder12, located on
[repl.it](https://repl.it/@Scoder12/aoc-rust-template).
